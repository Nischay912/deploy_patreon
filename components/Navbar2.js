                        What e.preventDefault() does??

                            - Normally, a <Link> or <a> tag has a default behavior:

                            - Clicking it navigates to the URL in href.

                            - Here, href="#" â†’ normally would jump to the top of the page (# anchor).

                            - e.preventDefault() stops that default navigation.

                            - This allows us to run our custom function (handleSignOut()) instead of letting the browser navigate.

                            - If you remove e.preventDefault(), then:

                            - Clicking the link will jump to # (top of page) immediately.

                            - handleSignOut() will still run, but the page may scroll/jump before logout finishes.

                            - It can look like the logout isnâ€™t working smoothly.

                            - So for clean UX, itâ€™s recommended to keep it when you use <Link href="#"> just as a button.
